###Week 1

So, here I stand inside the iOS Mobile Development course. I am very excited to be taking this opportunity given to me by The Iron Yard - Orlando. I find it to be a perfect place to develop an entirely new set of skills and get a new type of mindset on the way I learn. With these, I know a will accomplish much more than simply learning to code in some language.

Being away from my family and friends, speaking english most of the time, living in a whole new place has put me in the toughest life change I have been through. I have been a musician, and I have been a cook. I have never been a programmer, or have studied anything related to that.

To me, this is a whole new field. It seems to me that this could be a creative envorinment for me to try out. Coding is the new industrial era, but from an abstract point of view. Yes, coders build powerful tools and we use them every day to accomplish tasks or just to make our lives easier.

I have never done coding. Just a little old HTML before it became dynamic and complex, even before CSS even existed. During week 1, I had the opportunity to know new people with similar interests and similar situations that led us to the same place. We set up our stations, and installed a couple of apps we're going to be using throughout the course, and in our professional life. Apps like: Xcode, Github Desktop, Slack, and Macdown.

At class I learned:

* The basics of making a new proyect inside Xcode working around simple Xcode tasks like:
	* Making our way around the main storyboard and code files.
	* Working with view controllers, and table view controllers.
	* Changing some settings to make the text look better for us to work with.
	* Embed a navigation controller.
	* Make buttons, labels, date pickers.
	* Setup a segway to transition from view to view.
	* Constrain objects within a superview and between each other to make the UI more device and user friendly.

* The basics of Github:
	* Installing and making our way around the Github Desktop app.
	* Make a branch from a master branch.
	* Commit our work.
	* Sync the work from an existing branch.
	* Make a pull request.

Code-wise, I learned about:

* @IBOutlets.
* @IBActions.
* Classes, subclasses, properties and methods.

I still have to clear my doubts about how to implement classes and connect them to make them work. But I feel I know much more than when I started the program.

Other basic topics we went through:

* Variables.
* Constants.
* Integers, Floats, Doubles.
* Arrays.
* Dictionaries.
* Switches.
* Strings, String interpolation, and how to convert String into Int and viceversa.

These, I understood better. Learned how they store data, and how to manipulate that data between them.

This first week has proven to be a tough one. There's still lots of concepts that I still don't understand clearly. Appart from that, my brand new computer broke and I lost an entire week of work. I guess that will remind me for life about making my own backups and commiting my work correctly and frequently to Github.

My worry is not to be able to understand them before any more new concepts amount to them. Despite that, I realize how much I have learned throughout the week and I feel great about it. I'll just keep myself motivated and in the right set of mind. Try to focus more on what I have learned to do, and not compare myself to others. This is just the first week of a totally new life for me, and I know for sure it wont get any easier, but that is the thing that will make me succeed if I really want to grow out an entirely new person in me. Cheers!
